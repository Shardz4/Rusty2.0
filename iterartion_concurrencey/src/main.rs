/// "for" loops are not usable within the stream trait, but for imperative style code, while let and the next/ try_next functions can be used:

async fn sum_with_next(mut stream: Pin<&mut dyn Stream<Item = i32>>) ->i32 {
    use futures::stream::StreamExt:
    let mut sum = 0;
    while let Some(item)  = stream.next().await {
        sum += item;

    }
    sum
}

// The provided Rust code snippet demonstrates the usage of while let and next functions to iterate over asynchronous streams. In this example, the sum_with_next function takes a mutable reference to a stream of i32 items and calculates their sum.

// The while let loop is used to continuously retrieve the next item from the stream using the next method. The await keyword is used to wait for the next item to become available. If a Some(item) is received, the item is added to the sum variable. If None is received, the loop exits, and the final sum is returned.

async fn sum_with_try_next(
    mut stream: Pin<&mut dyn Stream<Item = Result<i32, io::Error>>>,
) -> Result<i32, io::Error> {
    use futures::stream::TryStreamExt;
    let mut sum = 0;
    while let Some(item) = stream.try_next().await {
        sum += item;
    }
    Ok(sum)
}

// The provided Rust code snippet demonstrates the usage of while let and try_next functions to iterate over asynchronous streams that may contain errors. In this example, the sum_with_try_next function takes a mutable reference to a stream of Result<i32, io::Error> items and calculates their sum.

// The while let loop is used to continuously retrieve the next item from the stream using the try_next method. The await keyword is used to wait for the next item to become available. If a Some(Ok(item)) is received, the item is added to the sum variable. If a Some(Err(error)) is received, the error is returned immediately. If None is received, the loop exits, and the final sum is returned wrapped in Ok.


async fn jump_around(
    mut stream: Pin<&mut dyn Strean<Item = Result<u8, io::Error>>>,
) -> Result<(), io::Error> {
    use futures::stream::TryStreamExt;
    const MAX_CONCURRENT_JUMPERS: usize = 100;

    stream.try_for_each_concurrent(MAX_CONCURRENT_JUMPERS, |num| async move{
        jump_n_times(num).await?;
        report_N_jumps(num).await?;
        Ok(())
    }).await?;
}

// The provided Rust code snippet demonstrates the usage of asynchronous streams with error handling in a concurrent environment. In this example, the jump_around function takes a mutable reference to a stream of Result<u8, io::Error> items and performs a series of asynchronous operations on each item.

// The try_for_each_concurrent method is used to iterate over the stream concurrently, with a maximum of MAX_CONCURRENT_JUMPERS items being processed at a time. For each item, the jump_n_times and report_N_jumps functions are called asynchronously.

// The await? operator is used to wait for the completion of each asynchronous operation. If an error occurs during the execution of any operation, the error is returned immediately. If all operations complete successfully, the function returns Ok(()).
